This is my first project built with Laravel, a powerful PHP framework. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills in web development and to learn more about Laravel's features and capabilities. 

In this project, user information such as name, surname, and age is displayed. It's a simple application that allows me to experiment with Laravel's routing, views, and templating features. 

Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback!
